\cvsection{About me}

\begin{cvparagraph}
I'm a Ph.D. student in Physics at Chongqing University, working on gravitational wave research. I've always been fascinated by physics and astronomyâ€”curious about how the universe works and what fundamental rules lie beneath it all. Gravitational waves give me a unique way to explore those questions. I hope to contribute something meaningful to the field someday... but first, I'm just hoping to graduate smoothly!
