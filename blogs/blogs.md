  <h2>This year</h2>

  <ul>


  <li>
      <strong>Oct 6:</strong> The National Day holiday is packed with so many dinner parties, and I'm afraid I'll end up gaining weight again. It's time to go back to school tomorrow.
    </li>
  <li>
      <strong>Sep 25:</strong> The good news is that my paper got accepted today! I'm so happy about it. It's actually the first paper of my doctoral stage.
    </li>
  <li>
      <strong>Sep 17:</strong> On Mid-Autumn Festival, me and my friends headed to Nan'an District. Despite the scorching heat, we we still had a blast.
    </li>

  <li>
      <strong>Sep 10:</strong> It's the first day of making my personal homepage, and I'm really excited about it! 🎉🎉
