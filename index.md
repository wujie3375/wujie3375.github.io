<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Hi there! Welcome to my personal website!</p>

I'm **Jie Wu**, a PhD candidate in physics (still working hard at it).

Currently, I'm studying at the College of Physics at Chongqing University, and my supervisor is [Prof. Jin Li](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1456898?ui-citation-summary=true&ui-exclude-self-citations=true). 
My main research focus is on simulating space gravitational wave signals, evaluating detector performance, and processing and analyzing gravitational wave data. 
I am interested in physics, astronomy, and aerospace.



If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at **wujie3375@gmail.com**.

## Research Interests

- Gravity
- Gravitational wave astronomy
- Compact binary system
- Cosmology

Over the past few years, I've been involved in gravitational wave research. It not only deepened my understanding of this area but also gave me basic research skills. 
In the future, I hope to expand my research further, explore new technologies and methods for space gravitational wave detection, and push forward the development of this field.
