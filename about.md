# About me

<!-- <img src="https://wujie3375.github.io/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480"> -->
 


<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Hi there! Welcome to my personal corner of the internet!</p>

I’m **Jie Wu**, a PhD student in Physics at **Chongqing University**, tuning in to the universe’s faintest whispers—**gravitational waves**. I spend my days wrangling signals, crunching mountains of data, and dreaming up clever ways to catch those sneaky ripples in spacetime—then chasing the answers with code, data, and (lots of) coffee.

My big dream? To unravel the essence of the universe and the fundamental rules that govern everything, hoping to make a meaningful impact in this field someday… but for now, let’s just focus on graduating smoothly with as few gray hairs as possible.

What gets me fired up:

- **Physics & Astronomy** — because figuring out how the cosmos works never gets old 🔭  
- **Aerospace** — rockets, satellites, and all the crazy tech that gets us off this little blue planet 🚀  
- **Photography** — capturing earthbound beauty while staring at the stars 📷  

(Oh, and if you’re wondering: I’m an *INTJ*—the classic big-picture thinker who loves details, plans everything, and drinks way too much coffee.)

Got something cool to share? Hit me up anytime at **wujie3375@gmail.com**.  
Can’t wait to explore the universe together—one gravitational wave (and one cup of coffee) at a time!

## Research Interests

- **Gravitational wave:**  
  Signal simulation, Post-Newtonian waveform.
- **Detection:**  
  Space- and ground-based detectors, Time-delay interferometry, Noise.
- **Binary system:**  
  Stellar binary black hole, Massive black hole binary, Galactic binary.
- **Data processing:**  
  Parameter estimation, Fisher matrix, Bayesian analysis.
- **Gravitation:**  
  Modified theory of gravity, Cosmology, Dark matter.
- **Astronomy:**  
  Electromagnetic observation, Multi-messenger observation.

Currently, my primary research focus is on the simulation of gravitational wave signals in space, assessment of detector performance, and the processing and analysis of gravitational wave data.
